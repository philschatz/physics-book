### Vectors in Two Dimensions

A **vector**{: data-type="term" #import-auto-id1165296389850} is a quantity that has magnitude and direction. Displacement, velocity, acceleration, and force, for example, are all vectors. In one-dimensional, or straight-line, motion, the direction of a vector can be given simply by a plus or minus sign. In two dimensions (2-d), however, we specify the direction of a vector relative to some reference frame (i.e., coordinate system), using an arrow having length proportional to the vector’s magnitude and pointing in the direction of the vector.

[\[link\]](#import-auto-id1165298666909) shows such a *graphical representation of a vector*, using as an example the total displacement for the person walking in a city considered in [Kinematics in Two Dimensions: An Introduction](/m42104). We shall use the notation that a boldface symbol, such as <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mstyle fontweight="bold"><mrow><mtext>D</mtext></mrow></mstyle><mrow /></mrow><annotation encoding="StarMath 5.0"> size 12{D} {}</annotation></semantics></math>

### Vector Addition: Head-to-Tail Method

The **head-to-tail method**{: data-type="term" #import-auto-id1165298552505} is a graphical way to add vectors, described in [\[link\]](#import-auto-id1165298643218) below and in the steps following. The **tail**{: data-type="term" #import-auto-id1165298535408} of the vector is the starting point of the vector, and the **head**{: data-type="term" #import-auto-id1165298982372} (or tip) of a vector is the final, pointed end of the arrow.

![In part a, a vector of magnitude of nine units and making an angle of theta is equal to zero degrees is drawn from the origin and along the positive direction of x axis. In part b a vector of magnitude of nine units and making an angle of theta is equal to zero degree is drawn from the origin and along the positive direction of x axis. Then a vertical arrow from the head of the horizontal arrow is drawn. In part c a vector D of magnitude ten point three is drawn from the tail of the horizontal vector at an angle theta is equal to twenty nine point one degrees from the positive direction of x axis. The head of the vector D meets the head of the vertical vector. A scale is shown parallel to the vector D to measure its length. Also a protractor is shown to measure the inclination of the vectorD.](../resources/Figure_03_02_03.jpg "Head-to-Tail Method: The head-to-tail method of graphically adding vectors is illustrated for the two displacements of the person walking in a city considered in [link].  (a) Draw a vector representing the displacement to the east. (b) Draw a vector representing the displacement to the north. The tail of this vector should originate from the head of the first, east-pointing vector. (c) Draw a line from the tail of the east-pointing vector to the head of the north-pointing vector to form the sum or resultant vector D size 12{A} {}. The length of the arrow D size 12{A} {} is proportional to the vector&#x2019;s magnitude and is measured to be 10.3 units . Its direction, described as the angle with respect to the east (or horizontal axis) &#x3B8; size 12{&#x3B8;} {} is measured with a protractor to be &#10;        &#10;          &#10;            &#10;              &#10;                &#10;                  29&#10;                  .&#10;                  1&#xBA;&#10;                &#10;              &#10;            &#10;            &#10;          &#10;           size 12{&quot;29&quot; &quot;.&quot; 1&#xB0;} {}&#10;        &#10;      ."){: #import-auto-id1165298643218}

***Step 1.*** **Draw an arrow to represent the first vector (9 blocks to the east) using a ruler and protractor**.

 ![In part a, a vector of magnitude of nine units and making an angle theta is equal to zero degree is drawn from the origin and along the positive direction of x axis.](../resources/Figure_03_02_04a.jpg){: #import-auto-id1165298876451 height="200"}

***Step 2.*** Now draw an arrow to represent the second vector (5 blocks to the north). *Place the tail of the second vector at the head of the first vector*.

![In part b, a vector of magnitude of nine units and making an angle theta is equal to zero degree is drawn from the origin and along the positive direction of x axis. Then a vertical vector from the head of the horizontal vector is drawn.](../resources/Figure_03_02_05a.jpg){: #import-auto-id1165298818267 height="200"}

***Step 3.*** *If there are more than two vectors, continue this process for each vector to be added. Note that in our example, we have only two vectors, so we have finished placing arrows tip to tail*.

***Step 4.*** *Draw an arrow from the tail of the first vector to the head of the last vector*. This is the **resultant**{: data-type="term" #import-auto-id1165296311722}, or the sum, of the other vectors.

![In part c, a vector D of magnitude ten point three is drawn from the tail of the horizontal vector at an angle theta is equal to twenty nine point one degrees from the positive direction of the x axis. The head of the vector D meets the head of the vertical vector. A scale is shown parallel to the vector D to measure its length. Also a protractor is shown to measure the inclination of the vector D.](../resources/Figure_03_02_06a.jpg){: #import-auto-id1165299000967}

***Step 5.*** To get the **magnitude**{: data-type="term" #import-auto-id1165298794109} of the resultant, *measure its length with a ruler. (Note that in most calculations, we will use the Pythagorean theorem to determine this length.)*

<strong><em>Step 6. </em></strong>To get the **direction**{: data-type="term" #import-auto-id1165298932041} of the resultant, **measure the angle it makes with the reference frame using a protractor. (Note that in most calculations, we will use trigonometric relationships to determine this angle.)**

The graphical addition of vectors is limited in accuracy only by the precision with which the drawings can be made and the precision of the measuring tools. It is valid for any number of vectors.

Adding Vectors Graphically Using the Head-to-Tail Method: A Woman Takes a Walk
</div>
Use the graphical technique for adding vectors to find the total displacement of a person who walks the following three paths (displacements) on a flat field. First, she walks 25.0 m in a direction <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mrow><mrow><mtext>49.0º</mtext></mrow></mrow><mrow /></mrow><annotation encoding="StarMath 5.0"> size 12{"49" "."

 north of east. Then, she walks 23.0 m heading <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mrow><mrow><mtext>15.0º</mtext></mrow></mrow><mrow /></mrow><annotation encoding="StarMath 5.0"> size 12{"15" "." "º°"} {}</annotation></semantics></math>

 north of east. Finally, she turns and walks 32.0 m in a direction 68.0° south of east.

**Strategy**

Represent each displacement vector graphically with an arrow, labeling the first <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mstyle fontweight="bold"><mrow><mtext>A</mtext></mrow></mstyle><mrow /></mrow><annotation encoding="StarMath 5.0"> size 12{A} {}</annotation></semantics></math>

, the second <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mstyle fontweight="bold"><mrow><mtext>B</mtext></mrow></mstyle><mrow /></mrow><annotation encoding="StarMath 5.0"> size 12{B} {}</annotation></semantics></math>

, and the third <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mstyle fontweight="bold"><mrow><mtext>C</mtext></mrow></mstyle><mrow /></mrow><annotation encoding="StarMath 5.0"> size 12{C} {}</annotation></semantics></math>

, making the lengths proportional to the distance and the directions as specified relative to an east-west line. The head-to-tail method outlined above will give a way to determine the magnitude and direction of the resultant displacement, denoted <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mrow><mtext mathvariant="bold">R</mtext></mrow><mrow /></mrow><annotation encoding="StarMath 5.0"> size 12{R} {}</annotation></semantics></math>

.

**Solution**

(1) Draw the three displacement vectors.

![On the graph a vector of magnitude twenty three meters and inclined above the x axis at an angle theta-b equal to fifteen degrees is shown. This vector is labeled as B.](../resources/Figure_03_02_08.jpg){: #import-auto-id1165296232338}


(2) Place the vectors head to tail retaining both their initial magnitude and direction.

![In this figure a vector A with a positive slope is drawn from the origin. Then from the head of the vector A another vector B with positive slope is drawn and then another vector C with negative slope from the head of the vector B is drawn which cuts the x axis.](../resources/Figure_03_02_09.jpg){: #import-auto-id1165298788198}


(3) Draw the resultant vector, <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mstyle fontweight="bold"><mrow><mtext>R</mtext></mrow></mstyle><mrow /></mrow><annotation encoding="StarMath 5.0"> size 12{R} {}</annotation></semantics></math>

.

![In this figure a vector A with a positive slope is drawn from the origin. Then from the head of the vector A another vector B with positive slope is drawn and then another vector C with negative slope from the head of the vector B is drawn which cuts the x axis. From the tail of the vector A a vector R of magnitude of fifty point zero meters and with negative slope of seven degrees is drawn. The head of this vector R meets the head of the vector C. The vector R is known as the resultant vector.](../resources/Figure_03_02_10.jpg){: #import-auto-id1165298786300}


(4) Use a ruler to measure the magnitude of <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mrow><mtext mathvariant="bold">R</mtext></mrow><mrow /></mrow><annotation encoding="StarMath 5.0"> size 12{R} {}</annotation></semantics></math>

, and a protractor to measure the direction of <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mstyle fontweight="bold"><mrow><mtext>R</mtext></mrow></mstyle><mrow /></mrow><annotation encoding="StarMath 5.0"> size 12{R} {}</annotation></semantics></math>

. While the direction of the vector can be specified in many ways, the easiest way is to measure the angle between the vector and the nearest horizontal or vertical axis. Since the resultant vector is south of the eastward pointing axis, we flip the protractor upside down and measure the angle between the eastward axis and the vector.

![In this figure a vector A with a positive slope is drawn from the origin. Then from the head of the vector A another vector B with positive slope is drawn and then another vector C with negative slope from the head of the vector B is drawn which cuts the x axis. From the tail of the vector A a vector R of magnitude of fifty meter and with negative slope of seven degrees is drawn. The head of this vector R meets the head of the vector C. The vector R is known as the resultant vector. A ruler is placed along the vector R to measure it. Also there is a protractor to measure the angle.](../resources/Figure_03_02_11a.jpg){: #import-auto-id1165298931707}


In this case, the total displacement <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mrow><mtext mathvariant="bold">R</mtext></mrow><mrow /></mrow><annotation encoding="StarMath 5.0"> size 12{R} {}</annotation></semantics></math>

 is seen to have a magnitude of 50.0 m and to lie in a direction <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mrow><mrow><mn>7.0º</mn></mrow></mrow><mrow /></mrow><annotation encoding="StarMath 5.0"> size 12{7 "." 0°} {}</annotation></semantics></math>

 south of east. By using its magnitude and direction, this vector can be expressed as <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"> <semantics> <mrow> <mrow> <mrow> <mi>R</mi> <mo stretchy="false">=</mo> <mtext>50.0 m</mtext> </mrow> </mrow> <mrow /> </mrow> <annotation encoding="StarMath 5.0"> size 12{R" = 50" "." "0 m"} {}</annotation> </semantics> </math>

 and <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mrow><mrow><mrow><mi>θ</mi><mo stretchy="false">=</mo><mn>7</mn></mrow><mtext>.</mtext><mtext>0º</mtext></mrow></mrow><mrow /></mrow><annotation encoding="StarMath 5.0"> size 12{θ=7 "." "0°"} {}</annotation></semantics></math>

 south of east.

**Discussion**

The head-to-tail graphical method of vector addition works for any number of vectors. It is also important to note that the resultant is independent of the order in which the vectors are added. Therefore, we could add the vectors in any order as illustrated in [\[link\]](#import-auto-id1165298931858) and we will still get the same solution.

![In this figure a vector C with a negative slope is drawn from the origin. Then from the head of the vector C another vector A with positive slope is drawn and then another vector B with negative slope from the head of the vector A is drawn. From the tail of the vector C a vector R of magnitude of fifty point zero meters and with negative slope of seven degrees is drawn. The head of this vector R meets the head of the vector B. The vector R is known as the resultant vector.](../resources/Figure_03_02_12.jpg){: #import-auto-id1165298931858}


Here, we see that when the same vectors are added in a different order, the result is the same. This characteristic is true in every case and is an important characteristic of vectors. Vector addition is **commutative**{: data-type="term"}. Vectors can be added in any order.

### Vector Subtraction

Vector subtraction is a straightforward extension of vector addition. To define subtraction (say we want to subtract <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mrow><mrow><mtext mathvariant="bold">B</mtext></mrow></mrow></mrow><annotation encoding="StarMath 5.0"> size 12{B} {}</annotation></semantics></math>

 from <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mrow><mrow><mtext mathvariant="bold">A</mtext></mrow></mrow></mrow><annotation encoding="StarMath 5.0"> size 12{A} {}</annotation></semantics></math>

 , written <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mrow><mrow><mtext mathvariant="bold">A</mtext> <mo>–</mo> <mtext mathvariant="bold">B</mtext></mrow></mrow></mrow><annotation encoding="StarMath 5.0"> size 12{ "A" "-B"} {}</annotation></semantics></math>

 , we must first define what we mean by subtraction. The *negative* of a vector <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mrow><mrow><mtext mathvariant="bold">B</mtext></mrow></mrow><mrow /></mrow></semantics></math>

 is defined to be <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mrow><mtext mathvariant="bold">–B</mtext></mrow></mrow></semantics></math>

; that is, graphically *the negative of any vector has the same magnitude but the opposite direction*, as shown in [\[link\]](#import-auto-id1165298692950). In other words, <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mrow><mtext mathvariant="bold">B</mtext></mrow><mrow /></mrow><annotation encoding="StarMath 5.0"> size 12{B} {}</annotation></semantics></math>

 has the same length as <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mrow><mrow><mtext mathvariant="bold">–B</mtext></mrow></mrow><mrow /></mrow><annotation encoding="StarMath 5.0"> size 12{"-" "B"} {}</annotation></semantics></math>

, but points in the opposite direction. Essentially, we just flip the vector so it points in the opposite direction.

![Two vectors are shown. One of the vectors is labeled as vector   in north east direction. The other vector is of the same magnitude and is in the opposite direction to that of vector B. This vector is denoted as negative B.](../resources/Figure_03_02_13a.jpg "The negative of a vector is just another vector of the same magnitude but pointing in the opposite direction. So B size 12{B} {} is the negative of &#x2013;B size 12{ ital &quot;-B&quot;} {}; it has the same length but opposite direction.      "){: #import-auto-id1165298692950 height="200"}

The **subtraction** of vector <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mrow><mtext mathvariant="bold">B</mtext></mrow><mrow /></mrow></semantics></math>

 from vector <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mrow><mtext mathvariant="bold">A</mtext></mrow><mrow /></mrow></semantics></math>

 is then simply defined to be the addition of <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mrow><mtext mathvariant="bold">–B</mtext></mrow><mrow /></mrow></semantics></math>

 to <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mrow><mtext mathvariant="bold">A</mtext></mrow><mrow /></mrow></semantics></math>

. Note that vector subtraction is the addition of a negative vector. The order of subtraction does not affect the results.

<div data-type="equation" id="eip-454">
<math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mrow><mrow><mstyle fontweight="bold"><mrow><mtext>A – B = A + </mtext></mrow></mstyle><mo stretchy="false">(</mo><mstyle><mrow><mtext fontweight="bold">–B</mtext></mrow></mstyle><mo stretchy="false">)</mo></mrow></mrow><mrow /><mtext>.</mtext></mrow><annotation encoding="StarMath 5.0"> size 12{ bold "A – B = A + " \( bold "–B" \) } {}</annotation></semantics></math>
</div>

This is analogous to the subtraction of scalars (where, for example, <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mrow><mrow><mtext>5 – 2 = 5 + </mtext><mo stretchy="false">(</mo><mtext>–2</mtext><mo stretchy="false">)</mo></mrow></mrow><mrow /></mrow><annotation encoding="StarMath 5.0"> size 12{"5 – 2 = 5 + " \( "–2" \) } {}</annotation></semantics></math>

). Again, the result is independent of the order in which the subtraction is made. When vectors are subtracted graphically, the techniques outlined above are used, as the following example illustrates.

**Solution**

(1) To determine the location at which the woman arrives by accident, draw vectors <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mrow><mtext mathvariant="bold">A</mtext></mrow><mrow /></mrow><annotation encoding="StarMath 5.0"> size 12{A} {}</annotation></semantics></math>

.

(2) Place the vectors head to tail.

(3) Draw the resultant vector <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mrow><mi mathvariant="bold">R</mi></mrow><mrow /></mrow><annotation encoding="StarMath 5.0"> size 12{R} {}</annotation></semantics></math>

.

![Vectors A and negative B are connected in head to tail method. Vector A is inclined with horizontal with positive slope and vector negative B with a negative slope. The resultant of these two vectors is shown as a vector R from tail of A to the head of negative B. The length of the resultant is twenty three point zero meters and has a negative slope of seven point five degrees.](../resources/Figure_03_02_16a.jpg){: #import-auto-id1165298476927}

(5) To determine the location of the dock, we repeat this method to add vectors <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mrow><mtext mathvariant="bold">A</mtext></mrow><mrow /></mrow><annotation encoding="StarMath 5.0"> size 12{A} {}</annotation></semantics></math>

  north of east.

We can see that the woman will end up a significant distance from the dock if she travels in the opposite direction for the second leg of the trip.

**Discussion**

Because subtraction of a vector is the same as addition of a vector with the opposite direction, the graphical method of subtracting vectors works the same as for addition.

</div>

### Multiplication of Vectors and Scalars

If we decided to walk three times as far on the first leg of the trip considered in the preceding example, then we would walk <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mrow><mrow><mrow><mtext>3 </mtext><mo stretchy="false">×</mo><mtext> 27</mtext></mrow><mtext>.</mtext><mtext>5 m</mtext></mrow></mrow><mrow /></mrow><annotation encoding="StarMath 5.0"> size 12{"3 " times " 27" "." "5 m"} {}</annotation></semantics></math>

, or 82.5 m, in a direction <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mrow><mrow><mtext>66</mtext><mtext>.</mtext><mn>0</mn><mrow><mtext>º</mtext></mrow></mrow></mrow><mrow /></mrow><annotation encoding="StarMath 5.0"> size 12{"66" "." 0 { size 12{º} } } {}</annotation></semantics></math>

 north of east. This is an example of multiplying a vector by a positive **scalar**{: data-type="term" #import-auto-id1165296219603}. Notice that the magnitude changes, but the direction stays the same.

If the scalar is negative, then multiplying a vector by it changes the vector’s magnitude and gives the new vector the **opposite** direction. For example, if you multiply by –2, the magnitude doubles but the direction changes. We can summarize these rules in the following way: When vector <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mrow><mi mathvariant="bold">A</mi></mrow><mrow /></mrow><annotation encoding="StarMath 5.0"> size 12{A} {}</annotation></semantics></math>

 is multiplied by a scalar <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mrow><mi>c</mi></mrow><mrow /></mrow><annotation encoding="StarMath 5.0"> size 12{c} {}</annotation></semantics></math>

,

* {: #import-auto-id1165298651742} the magnitude of the vector becomes the absolute value of
  <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mrow><mi>c</mi></mrow><mrow /></mrow><annotation encoding="StarMath 5.0"> size 12{c} {}</annotation></semantics></math>

  ,

  <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mrow><mi>c</mi></mrow><mrow /></mrow><annotation encoding="StarMath 5.0"> size 12{A} {}</annotation></semantics></math>
  
  is positive, the direction of the vector does not change,
* {: #import-auto-id1165298455414} if
  <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mrow><mi>c</mi></mrow><mrow /></mrow><annotation encoding="StarMath 5.0"> size 12{A} {}</annotation></semantics></math>
  
  is negative, the direction is reversed.

In our case, <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mrow><mrow><mi>c</mi><mo>=</mo><mn>3</mn></mrow></mrow></mrow><annotation encoding="StarMath 5.0">size 12{c=3}</annotation></semantics></math>

. Vectors are multiplied by scalars in many situations. Note that division is the inverse of multiplication. For example, dividing by 2 is the same as multiplying by the value (1/2). The rules for multiplication of vectors by scalars are the same for division; simply treat the divisor as a scalar between 0 and 1.

### Resolving a Vector into Components

In the examples above, we have been adding vectors to determine the resultant vector. In many cases, however, we will need to do the opposite. We will need to take a single vector and find what other vectors added together produce it. In most cases, this involves determining the perpendicular <strong data-type="term" id="import-auto-id1165298555736">components </strong>of a single vector, for example the **x**-<em> and</em> **y**-components, or the north-south and east-west components.

For example, we may know that the total displacement of a person walking in a city is 10.3 blocks in a direction <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mrow><mrow><mtext>29</mtext><mtext>.0º</mtext></mrow></mrow></mrow><annotation encoding="StarMath 5.0"> size 12{"29" "." 0º} } {}</annotation></semantics></math>

 north of east and want to find out how many blocks east and north had to be walked. This method is called **finding the components (or parts)** of the displacement in the east and north directions, and it is the inverse of the process followed to find the total displacement. It is one example of finding the components of a vector. There are many applications in physics where this is a useful thing to do. We will see this soon in [Projectile Motion](/m42042), and much more when we cover **forces** in [Dynamics: Newton’s Laws of Motion](/m42129). Most of these involve finding components along perpendicular axes (such as north and east), so that right triangles are involved. The analytical techniques presented in [Vector Addition and Subtraction: Analytical Methods](/m42128) are ideal for finding vector components.
