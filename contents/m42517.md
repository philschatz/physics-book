* Discuss the Rayleigh criterion.

</div>

Light diffracts as it moves through space, bending around obstacles, interfering constructively and destructively. While this can be used as a spectroscopic tool—a diffraction grating disperses light according to wavelength, for example, and is used to produce spectra—diffraction also limits the detail we can obtain in images. [\[link\]](#import-auto-id1169737923880)(a) shows the effect of passing light through a small circular aperture. Instead of a bright spot with sharp edges, a spot with a fuzzy edge surrounded by circles of light is obtained. This pattern is caused by diffraction similar to that produced by a single slit. Light from different parts of the circular aperture interferes constructively and destructively. The effect is most noticeable when the aperture is small, but the effect is there for large apertures, too.

![Part a of the figure shows a single circular spot of bright light; the light is dimmer around the edges. Part b of the figure shows two circles of light barely overlapping, forming a figure eight; the dimmer light surrounds the outer edges of the figure eight, but is slightly brighter where the two circles intersect. Part c of the figure shows two circles of light almost completely overlapping; again the dimmer light surrounds the edges but is slightly brighter where the two circles intersect.](../resources/Figure_28_06_01a.jpg "(a) Monochromatic light passed through a small circular aperture produces this diffraction pattern. (b) Two point light sources that are close to one another produce overlapping images because of diffraction. (c) If they are closer together, they cannot be resolved or distinguished."){: #import-auto-id1169737923880 data-media-type="image/jpg"}

How does diffraction affect the detail that can be observed when light passes through an aperture? [\[link\]](#import-auto-id1169737923880)(b) shows the diffraction pattern produced by two point light sources that are close to one another. The pattern is similar to that for a single point source, and it is just barely possible to tell that there are two light sources rather than one. If they were closer together, as in [\[link\]](#import-auto-id1169737923880)(c), we could not distinguish them, thus limiting the detail or resolution we can obtain. This limit is an inescapable consequence of the wave nature of light.

There are many situations in which diffraction limits the resolution. The acuity of our vision is limited because light passes through the pupil, the circular aperture of our eye. Be aware that the diffraction-like spreading of light is due to the limited diameter of a light beam, not the interaction with an aperture. Thus light passing through a lens with a diameter <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mrow><mi>D</mi></mrow><mrow /></mrow><annotation encoding="StarMath 5.0"> size 12{D} {}</annotation></semantics></math>

 shows this effect and spreads, blurring the image, just as light passing through an aperture of diameter <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mrow><mi>D</mi></mrow><mrow /></mrow><annotation encoding="StarMath 5.0"> size 12{D} {}</annotation></semantics></math>

 does. So diffraction limits the resolution of any system having a lens or mirror. Telescopes are also limited by diffraction, because of the finite diameter <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mrow><mi>D</mi></mrow><mrow /></mrow><annotation encoding="StarMath 5.0"> size 12{D} {}</annotation></semantics></math>

 of their primary mirror.

Take-Home Experiment: Resolution of the Eye
</div>
Draw two lines on a white sheet of paper (several mm apart). How far away can you be and still distinguish the two lines? What does this tell you about the size of the eye’s pupil? Can you be quantitative? (The size of an adult’s pupil is discussed in [Physics of the Eye](/m42482).)

</div>

Just what is the limit? To answer that question, consider the diffraction pattern for a circular aperture, which has a central maximum that is wider and brighter than the maxima surrounding it (similar to a slit) \[see [\[link\]](#import-auto-id1169738035905)(a)\]. It can be shown that, for a circular aperture of diameter <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mrow><mi>D</mi></mrow><mrow /></mrow><annotation encoding="StarMath 5.0"> size 12{D} {}</annotation></semantics></math>

 (providing the aperture is large compared with the wavelength of light, which is the case for most optical instruments). The accepted criterion for determining the diffraction limit to resolution based on this angle was developed by Lord Rayleigh in the 19th century. The **Rayleigh criterion**{: data-type="term" #import-auto-id1169738104450} for the diffraction limit to resolution states that *two images are just resolvable when the center of the diffraction pattern of one is directly over the first minimum of the diffraction pattern of the other*. See [\[link\]](#import-auto-id1169738035905)(b).

Part b of the figure shows a drawing in which two light bulbs, labeled object one and object two, appear in the foreground positioned next to each other. Two rays of light, one from each light bulb, pass through a pinhole aperture and continue on to strike a screen that is farther back in the drawing. On the screen is an x y plot of the two resulting intensity patterns. Because the rays cross in the pinhole, the ray from the left light bulb makes the right-hand intensity pattern, and vice versa. The angle between the rays coming from the light bulbs is labeled theta min. Each ray hits the screen at the central maximum of the intensity pattern that corresponds to the object from which the ray came.

Connections: Limits to Knowledge
</div>
All attempts to observe the size and shape of objects are limited by the wavelength of the probe. Even the small wavelength of light prohibits exact precision. When extremely small wavelength probes as with an electron microscope are used, the system is disturbed, still limiting our knowledge, much as making an electrical measurement alters a circuit. Heisenberg’s uncertainty principle asserts that this limit is fundamental and inescapable, as we shall see in quantum mechanics.

Calculating Diffraction Limits of the Hubble Space Telescope
</div>
The primary mirror of the orbiting Hubble Space Telescope has a diameter of 2.40 m. Being in orbit, this telescope avoids the degrading effects of atmospheric distortion on its resolution. (a) What is the angle between two just-resolvable point light sources (perhaps two stars)? Assume an average light wavelength of 550 nm. (b) If these two stars are at the 2 million light year distance of the Andromeda galaxy, how close together can they be and still be resolved? (A light year, or ly, is the distance light travels in 1 year.)

**Discussion**

The angle found in part (a) is extraordinarily small (less than 1/50,000 of a degree), because the primary mirror is so large compared with the wavelength of light. As noticed, diffraction effects are most noticeable when light interacts with objects having sizes on the order of the wavelength of light. However, the effect is still there, and there is a diffraction limit to what is observable. The actual resolution of the Hubble Telescope is not quite as good as that found here. As with all instruments, there are other effects, such as non-uniformities in mirrors or aberrations in lenses that further limit resolution. However, [\[link\]](#import-auto-id1169737911438) gives an indication of the extent of the detail observable with the Hubble because of its size and quality and especially because it is above the Earth’s atmosphere.

![Two pictures of the same galaxy taken by different telescopes are shown side by side. Photo a was taken with a ground-based telescope. It is quite blurry and black and white. Photo b was taken with the Hubble Space Telescope. It shows much more detail, including what looks like a gas cloud in front of the galaxy, and is in color.](../resources/Figure_28_06_03a.jpg "These two photographs of the M82 galaxy give an idea of the observable detail using the Hubble Space Telescope compared with that using a ground-based telescope.

The answer in part (b) indicates that two stars separated by about half a light year can be resolved. The average distance between stars in a galaxy is on the order of 5 light years in the outer parts and about 1 light year near the galactic center. Therefore, the Hubble can resolve most of the individual stars in Andromeda galaxy, even though it lies at such a huge distance that its light takes 2 million years for its light to reach us.

 is important because it relates to the resolving power of a lens.

 will also be able to collect more light and so give a brighter image. Another way to describe this situation is that the larger the <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mrow><mstyle fontstyle="italic"><mrow><mtext>NA</mtext></mrow></mstyle></mrow><mrow /></mrow><annotation encoding="StarMath 5.0"> size 12{ ital "NA"} {}</annotation></semantics></math>

, the larger the cone of light that can be brought into the lens, and so more of the diffraction modes will be collected. Thus the microscope has more information to form a clear image, and so its resolving power will be higher.

 ![Part a of the figure shows two small objects arranged vertically a distance x one above the other on the left side of the schematic. On the right side, at a distance lowercase d from the two objects, is a vertical oval shape that represents a convex lens. The middle of the lens is on the horizontal bisector between the two points on the left. Two rays, one from each object on the left, leave the objects and pass through the center of the lens. The distance d is significantly longer than the distance x. Part b of the figure shows a horizontal oval representing a convex lens labeled microscope objective that is a distance lowercase d above a flat surface.

One of the consequences of diffraction is that the focal point of a beam has a finite width and intensity distribution. Consider focusing when only considering geometric optics, shown in [\[link\]](#import-auto-id1169737966965)(a). The focal point is infinitely small with a huge intensity and the capacity to incinerate most samples irrespective of the <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mrow><mstyle fontstyle="italic"><mrow><mtext>NA</mtext></mrow></mstyle></mrow><mrow /></mrow><annotation encoding="StarMath 5.0"> size 12{ ital "NA"} {}</annotation></semantics></math>

 of the objective lens. For wave optics, due to diffraction, the focal point spreads to become a focal spot (see [\[link\]](#import-auto-id1169737966965)(b)) with the size of the spot decreasing with increasing <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mrow><mstyle fontstyle="italic"><mrow><mtext>NA</mtext></mrow></mstyle></mrow><mrow /></mrow><annotation encoding="StarMath 5.0"> size 12{ ital "NA"} {}</annotation></semantics></math>

. Consequently, the intensity in the focal spot increases with increasing <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mrow><mstyle fontstyle="italic"><mrow><mtext>NA</mtext></mrow></mstyle></mrow><mrow /></mrow><annotation encoding="StarMath 5.0"> size 12{ ital "NA"} {}</annotation></semantics></math>

. The higher the <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mrow><mstyle fontstyle="italic"><mrow><mtext>NA</mtext></mrow></mstyle></mrow><mrow /></mrow><annotation encoding="StarMath 5.0"> size 12{ ital "NA"} {}</annotation></semantics></math>

, the greater the chances of photodegrading the specimen. However, the spot never becomes a true point.

![The first schematic is labeled geometric optics focus. It shows an edge-on view of a thin lens that is vertical. The lens is represented by a thin ellipse. Two parallel horizontal rays impinge upon the lens from the left. One ray goes through the upper edge of the lens and is deviated downward at about a thirty degree angle below the horizontal. The other ray goes through the lower edge of the lens and is deviated upward at about a thirty degree angle above the horizontal. These two rays cross a point that is labeled focal point. The second schematic is labeled wave optics focus. It is similar to the first schematic, except that the rays do not quite cross at the focal point. Instead, they diverge away from each other at the same angle as they approached each other. The region of closest approach for the lines is called the focal region.](../resources/Figure_28_06_07a.jpg "(a) In geometric optics, the focus is a point, but it is not physically possible to produce such a point because it implies infinite intensity.

**Construct Your Own Problem**

Consider diffraction limits for an electromagnetic wave interacting with a circular object. Construct a problem in which you calculate the limit of angular resolution with a device, using this circular object (such as a lens, mirror, or antenna) to make observations. Also calculate the limit to spatial resolution (such as the size of features observable on the Moon) for observations at a specific distance from the device. Among the things to be considered are the wavelength of electromagnetic radiation used, the size of the circular object, and the distance to the system or phenomenon being observed.
