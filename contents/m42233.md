People are shown working on the turbine.](../resources/Figure_16_02_01a.jpg "Beginning with the Industrial Revolution, humans have harnessed power through the use of the first law of thermodynamics, before we even understood it completely.

One of the most important things we can do with heat transfer is to use it to do work for us. Such a device is called a **heat engine**{: data-type="term" #import-auto-id1169738183063}. Car engines and steam turbines that generate electricity are examples of heat engines. [\[link\]](#import-auto-id1169737781930) shows schematically how the first law of thermodynamics applies to the typical heat engine.

 ![The figure shows a schematic representation of a heat engine. The heat engine is represented by a circle. The heat entering the system is shown as Q sub in, represented as a bold arrow toward the circle, and the heat coming out of the heat engine is shown as Q sub out, represented by a narrower bold arrow leaving the circle. The work labeled as W is shown to leave the heat engine as represented by another bold arrow leaving the circle. At the center of the circle are two equations. First, the change in internal energy of the system, delta U, equals zero. Consequently, W equals Q sub in minus Q sub out.](../resources/Figure_16_02_02a.jpg "Schematic representation of a heat engine, governed, of course, by the first law of thermodynamics.

![Figure a shows a piston attached to a movable cylinder which is attached to the right of another gas filled cylinder. The heat Q sub in is shown to be transferred to the gas in the cylinder as shown by a bold arrow toward it. The force of the gas on the moving cylinder with the piston is shown as F equals P times A shown as a vector arrow pointing toward the right. The change in internal energy is marked in the diagram as delta U sub a equals Q sub in. Figure b shows a piston attached to a movable cylinder which is attached to the right of another gas filled cylinder. The force of the gas has moved the cylinder with the piston by a distance d toward the right. The change in internal energy is marked in the diagram as delta U sub b equals negative W sub out. The piston is shown to have done work by change in position, marked as F d equal to W sub out. Figure c shows a piston attached to a movable cylinder which is attached to the right of another gas filled cylinder. The piston attached to the cylinder is shown to reach back to the initial position shown in figure a. The distance d is traveled back and heat Q sub out is shown to leave the system as represented by an outward arrow. The force driving backward is shown as a vector arrow pointing to the left, labeled F prime. F prime is shown less than F. The work done by the force F prime is shown by the equation W sub in equal to F prime times d.](../resources/Figure_16_02_03a.jpg "(a) Heat transfer to the gas in a cylinder increases the internal energy of the gas, creating higher pressure and temperature. (b) The force exerted on the movable cylinder does work as the gas expands. Gas pressure and temperature decrease when it expands, indicating that the gas&#x2019;s internal energy has been decreased by doing work. (c) Heat transfer to the environment further reduces pressure in the gas so that the piston can be more easily returned to its starting position."){: #import-auto-id1169737757532}

The illustrations above show one of the ways in which heat transfer does work. Fuel combustion produces heat transfer to a gas in a cylinder, increasing the pressure of the gas and thereby the force it exerts on a movable piston. The gas does work on the outside world, as this force moves the piston through some distance. Heat transfer to the gas cylinder results in work being done. To repeat this process, the piston needs to be returned to its starting point. Heat transfer now occurs from the gas to the surroundings so that its pressure decreases, and a force is exerted by the surroundings to push the piston back through some distance. Variations of this process are employed daily in hundreds of millions of heat engines. We will examine heat engines in detail in the next section. In this section, we consider some of the simpler underlying processes on which heat engines are based.

# *PV* Diagrams and their Relationship to Work Done on or by a Gas

A process by which a gas does work on a piston at constant pressure is called an **isobaric process**{: data-type="term" #import-auto-id1169737786623}. Since the pressure is constant, the force exerted is constant and the work done is given as

A force F equals P times A is shown to act upward from the bottom of the cylinder. The piston is shown to have been displaced by a vertical distance d upward. The volume displaced is given by delta V equals A times d. The work output shown as W sub out is equal to F times d, which is also equal to P times A times d, which in turn equals P times delta V.](../resources/Figure_16_02_04a.jpg "An isobaric expansion of a gas requires heat transfer to keep the pressure constant.

We can see where this leads by considering [\[link\]](#import-auto-id1169738072579)(a), which shows a more general process in which both pressure and volume change. The area under the curve is closely approximated by dividing it into strips, each having an average constant pressure <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mrow><msub><mi>P</mi><mrow><mrow><mi>i</mi><mo stretchy="false">(</mo><mtext>ave</mtext><mo stretchy="false">)</mo></mrow></mrow></msub></mrow><mrow /></mrow><annotation encoding="StarMath 5.0"> size 12{P rSub { size 8{i \( "ave" \) } } } {}</annotation></semantics></math>

. Thus the total work done is the total area under the curve. If the path is reversed, as in [\[link\]](#import-auto-id1169738072579)(b), then work is done on the system. The area under the curve in that case is negative, because <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mrow><mn>Δ</mn><mi>V</mi></mrow><mrow /></mrow><annotation encoding="StarMath 5.0"> size 12{ΔV} {}</annotation></semantics></math>

 diagrams clearly illustrate that *the work done depends on the path taken and not just the endpoints*. This path dependence is seen in [\[link\]](#import-auto-id1169738251372)(a), where more work is done in going from A to C by the path via point B than by the path via point D. The vertical paths, where volume is constant, are called **isochoric**{: data-type="term" #import-auto-id1169737793733} processes. Since volume is constant, <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mrow><mrow><mn>Δ</mn><mi>V</mi><mo stretchy="false">=</mo><mn>0</mn></mrow></mrow><mrow /></mrow><annotation encoding="StarMath 5.0"> size 12{ΔV=0} {}</annotation></semantics></math>

, and no work is done in an isochoric process. Now, if the system follows the cyclical path ABCDA, as in [\[link\]](#import-auto-id1169738251372)(b), then the total work done is the area inside the loop. The negative area below path CD subtracts, leaving only the area inside the rectangle. In fact, the work done in any cyclical process (one that returns to its starting point) is the area inside the loop it forms on a <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mrow><mstyle fontstyle="italic"><mrow><mtext>PV</mtext></mrow></mstyle></mrow><mrow /></mrow><annotation encoding="StarMath 5.0"> size 12{ ital "PV"} {}</annotation></semantics></math>

The paths A B and D C represent isobaric processes as shown by lines pointing toward the right, and A D and B C represent isochoric processes, as shown by lines pointing vertically downward. W sub A B C is shown greater than W sub A D C. The area below the curve A B C D, filling the rectangle A B C D, and the area immediately below path D C are also shaded.

The paths A B and C D represent isobaric processes; A B is a line pointing to the right, and C D is a line pointing to the left. The paths B C and D A represent isochoric processes; B C points vertically downward, and D A points vertically upward.

The line A B on the graph is shown to have a pressure P sub A B equals one point five multiplied by ten to the power six Newtons per meter square. The line D on the graph is shown to have a pressure P sub C D equals one point two multiplied by ten to the power five Newtons per meter squared. The total work is marked as W sub tot equals W sub out plus W sub in. Part c of the diagram shows a pressure versus volume graph. The pressure is along the Y axis and the volume is along the X axis.

The work is greater for the path ABC than for the path ADC, because the former is at higher pressure. In both cases, the work done is the area under the path. This area is greater for path ABC.

**Discussion**

The result, as anticipated, is that the area inside the closed loop equals the work done. The area is often easier to calculate than is the work done along each path. It is also convenient to visualize the area inside different curves on <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mrow><mstyle fontstyle="italic"><mrow><mtext>PV</mtext></mrow></mstyle></mrow><mrow /></mrow><annotation encoding="StarMath 5.0"> size 12{ ital "PV"} {}</annotation></semantics></math>

 diagrams in order to see which processes might produce the most work.

The upper curve ending at point B is an **isothermal**{: data-type="term" #import-auto-id1169737754472} process—that is, one in which temperature is kept constant.

 is a constant for an isothermal process. We ordinarily expect the temperature of a gas to decrease as it expands, and so we correctly suspect that heat transfer must occur from the surroundings to the gas to keep the temperature constant during an isothermal expansion. To show this more rigorously for the special case of a monatomic ideal gas, we note that the average kinetic energy of an atom in such a gas is given by

 is the number of atoms in the gas.

. If the internal energy does not change, then the net heat transfer into the gas must equal the net work done by the gas. That is, because <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mrow><mrow><mrow><mn>Δ</mn><mi>U</mi><mo stretchy="false">=</mo><mrow><mi>Q</mi><mo stretchy="false">−</mo><mi>W</mi></mrow></mrow><mo stretchy="false">=</mo><mn>0</mn></mrow></mrow><mrow /></mrow><annotation encoding="StarMath 5.0"> size 12{ΔU=Q - W=0} {}</annotation></semantics></math>

. We must have just enough heat transfer to replace the work done. An isothermal process is inherently slow, because heat transfer occurs continuously to keep the gas temperature constant at all times and must be allowed to spread through the gas so that there are no hot or cold regions.

Also shown in [\[link\]](#import-auto-id1169736581959)(a) is a curve AC for an **adiabatic**{: data-type="term" #import-auto-id1169737822182} process, defined to be one in which there is no heat transfer—that is, <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mrow><mrow><mi>Q</mi><mo stretchy="false">=</mo><mn>0</mn></mrow></mrow><mrow /></mrow><annotation encoding="StarMath 5.0"> size 12{Q=0} {}</annotation></semantics></math>

. Processes that are nearly adiabatic can be achieved either by using very effective insulation or by performing the process so fast that there is little time for heat transfer. Temperature must decrease during an adiabatic process, since work is done at the expense of internal energy:

(You might have noted that a gas released into atmospheric pressure from a pressurized cylinder is substantially colder than the gas in the cylinder.) In fact, because <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mrow><mrow><mrow><mi>Q</mi><mo stretchy="false">=</mo><mn>0, </mn></mrow><mn>Δ</mn><mi>U</mi><mo>=</mo><mo>–</mo><mi>W</mi></mrow></mrow><mrow /></mrow><annotation encoding="StarMath 5.0"> size 12{Q=0, DU"=-"W} {}</annotation></semantics></math>

 for an adiabatic process. Lower temperature results in lower pressure along the way, so that curve AC is lower than curve AB, and less work is done. If the path ABCA could be followed by cooling the gas from B to C at constant volume (isochorically), [\[link\]](#import-auto-id1169736581959)(b), there would be a net work output.

![Part a of the figure shows a graph for pressure versus volume. The pressure is along the y axis and the volume is along the x axis. There are two curves. The first curve begins at point A and falls smoothly downward to point B. The graph is shown for an isothermal process. The second curve also begins at point A but falls below the first curve and ends at point C vertically below point B. This graph is shown for an adiabatic process. A line joins point B and C to meet on the X axis. Also a line is drawn from point A to meet the X axis. The area under both the curves is shaded. The graph in figure b is similar to the graph in figure a. Only the directions of the curves are changed. The graph begins from A and moves downward to point B. Then from point B the curve drops vertically downward to C. From point C the graph has a smooth rise back to point A. All directions represented using arrows.](../resources/Figure_16_02_08a.jpg "(a) The upper curve is an isothermal process (&#x394;T=0 size 12{&#x394;T=0} {}), whereas the lower curve is an adiabatic process (Q=0 size 12{Q=0} {}). Both start from the same point A, but the isothermal process does more work than the adiabatic because heat transfer into the gas takes place to keep its temperature constant. This keeps the pressure higher all along the isothermal path than along the adiabatic path, producing more work. The adiabatic path thus ends up with a lower pressure and temperature at point C, even though the final volume is the same as for the isothermal process. (b) The cycle ABCA produces a net work output."){: #import-auto-id1169736581959}

# Reversible Processes

Both isothermal and adiabatic processes such as shown in [\[link\]](#import-auto-id1169736581959) are reversible in principle. A **reversible process**{: data-type="term" #import-auto-id1169738250360} is one in which both the system and its environment can return to exactly the states they were in by following the reverse path. The reverse isothermal and adiabatic paths are BA and CA, respectively. Real macroscopic processes are never exactly reversible. In the previous examples, our system is a gas (like that in [\[link\]](#import-auto-id1169738117758)), and its environment is the piston, cylinder, and the rest of the universe. If there are any energy-dissipating mechanisms, such as friction or turbulence, then heat transfer to the environment occurs for either direction of the piston. So, for example, if the path BA is followed and there is friction, then the gas will be returned to its original state but the environment will not—it will have been heated in both directions. Reversibility requires the direction of heat transfer to reverse for the reverse path. Since dissipative mechanisms cannot be completely eliminated, real processes cannot be reversible.

There must be reasons that real macroscopic processes cannot be reversible. We can imagine them going in reverse. For example, heat transfer occurs spontaneously from hot to cold and never spontaneously the reverse. Yet it would not violate the first law of thermodynamics for this to happen. In fact, all spontaneous processes, such as bubbles bursting, never go in reverse. There is a second thermodynamic law that forbids them from going in reverse. When we study this law, we will learn something about nature and also find that such a law limits the efficiency of heat engines. We will find that heat engines with the greatest possible theoretical efficiency would have to use reversible processes, and even they cannot convert all heat transfer into doing work.

# Section Summary

* {: #import-auto-id1169736609278} One of the important implications of the first law of thermodynamics is that machines can be harnessed to do work that humans previously did by hand or by external energy supplies such as running water or the heat of the Sun. A machine that uses heat transfer to do work is known as a heat engine.
* {: #import-auto-id1169737050912} There are several simple processes, used by heat engines, that flow from the first law of thermodynamics. Among them are the isobaric, isochoric, isothermal and adiabatic processes.
* {: #import-auto-id1169737846866} These processes differ from one another based on how they affect pressure, volume, temperature, and heat transfer.
* {: #import-auto-id1169737988065} If the work done is performed on the outside environment, work (
  <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mrow><mi>W</mi></mrow><mrow /></mrow><annotation encoding="StarMath 5.0"> size 12{W} {}</annotation></semantics></math>
  
  ) will be a positive value. If the work done is done to the heat engine system, work (
  <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mrow><mi>W</mi></mrow><mrow /></mrow><annotation encoding="StarMath 5.0"> size 12{W} {}</annotation></semantics></math>
  
  ) will be a negative value.
* {: #import-auto-id1169737787905} Some thermodynamic processes, including isothermal and adiabatic processes, are reversible in theory; that is, both the thermodynamic system and the environment can be returned to their initial states. However, because of loss of energy owing to the second law of thermodynamics, complete reversibility does not work in practice.

# Conceptual Questions

<div data-type="exercise" class="exercise" data-element-type="conceptual-questions">
<div data-type="problem" class="problem" markdown="1">
A great deal of effort, time, and money has been spent in the quest for the so-called perpetual-motion machine, which is defined as a hypothetical machine that operates or produces useful work indefinitely and/or a hypothetical machine that produces more work or energy than it consumes. Explain, in terms of heat engines and the first law of thermodynamics, why or why not such a machine is likely to be constructed.

One method of converting heat transfer into doing work is for heat transfer into a gas to take place, which expands, doing work on a piston, as shown in the figure below. (a) Is the heat transfer converted directly to work in an isobaric process, or does it go through another form first? Explain your answer. (b) What about in an isothermal process? (c) What about in an adiabatic process (where heat transfer occurred prior to the adiabatic process)?

![Figure a shows a piston attached to a movable cylinder which is attached to the right of another gas filled cylinder. The heat Q sub in is shown to be transferred to the gas in the cylinder as shown by a bold arrow toward it. The force of the gas on the moving cylinder with the piston is shown as F equals P times A shown as a vector arrow pointing toward the right. The change in internal energy is marked in the diagram as delta U sub a equals Q sub in. Figure b shows a piston attached to a movable cylinder which is attached to the right of another gas filled cylinder. The force of the gas has moved the cylinder with the piston by a distance d toward the right. The change in internal energy is marked in the diagram as delta U sub b equals negative W sub out. The piston is shown to have done work by change in position, marked as F d equal to W sub out. Figure c shows a piston attached to a movable cylinder which is attached to the right of another gas filled cylinder. The piston attached to the cylinder is shown to reach back to the initial position shown in figure a.
