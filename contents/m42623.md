The discovery and study of nuclear radioactivity quickly revealed evidence of revolutionary new physics. In addition, uses for nuclear radiation also emerged quickly—for example, people such as Ernest Rutherford used it to determine the size of the nucleus and devices were painted with radon-doped paint to make them glow in the dark (see [\[link\]](#import-auto-id3209830)). We therefore begin our study of nuclear physics with the discovery and basic features of nuclear radioactivity.

It is a poignant reminder of the dual nature of radiation. Although radium paint dials are conveniently visible day and night, they emit radon, a radioactive gas that is hazardous and is not directly sensed.

# Discovery of Nuclear Radioactivity

In 1896, the French physicist Antoine Henri Becquerel (1852–1908) accidentally found that a uranium-rich mineral called pitchblende emits invisible, penetrating rays that can darken a photographic plate enclosed in an opaque envelope. The rays therefore carry energy; but amazingly, the pitchblende emits them continuously without any energy input. This is an apparent violation of the law of conservation of energy, one that we now understand is due to the conversion of a small amount of mass into energy, as related in Einstein’s famous equation <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mrow><mrow><mi mathvariant="italic">E</mi><mo>=</mo><msup><mi mathvariant="italic">mc</mi><mrow><mn>2</mn></mrow></msup></mrow></mrow><mrow /></mrow><annotation encoding="StarMath 5.0"> size 12{"10" rSup { size 8{6} } "eV"} {}</annotation></semantics></math>

. It was soon evident that Becquerel’s rays originate in the nuclei of the atoms and have other unique characteristics. The emission of these rays is called **nuclear radioactivity** or simply **radioactivity**{: data-type="term"}. The rays themselves are called **nuclear radiation**{: data-type="term"}. A nucleus that spontaneously destroys part of its mass to emit radiation is said to **decay**{: data-type="term"} (a term also used to describe the emission of radiation by atoms in excited states). A substance or object that emits nuclear radiation is said to be **radioactive**{: data-type="term"}.

Two types of experimental evidence imply that Becquerel’s rays originate deep in the heart (or nucleus) of an atom. First, the radiation is found to be associated with certain elements, such as uranium. Radiation does not vary with chemical state—that is, uranium is radioactive whether it is in the form of an element or compound. In addition, radiation does not vary with temperature, pressure, or ionization state of the uranium atom. Since all of these factors affect electrons in an atom, the radiation cannot come from electron transitions, as atomic spectra do. The huge energy emitted during each event is the second piece of evidence that the radiation cannot be atomic. Nuclear radiation has energies of the order of <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mrow><mrow><msup><mtext>10</mtext><mrow><mn>6</mn></mrow></msup><mspace width="0.25em" /><mtext>eV</mtext></mrow></mrow><mrow /></mrow><annotation encoding="StarMath 5.0"> size 12{"10" rSup { size 8{6} } "eV"} {}</annotation></semantics></math>

 per event, which is much greater than the typical atomic energies (a few <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mrow><mtext>eV</mtext></mrow><mrow /></mrow><annotation encoding="StarMath 5.0"> size 12{"eV"} {}</annotation></semantics></math>

), such as that observed in spectra and chemical reactions, and more than ten times as high as the most energetic characteristic x rays. Becquerel did not vigorously pursue his discovery for very long. In 1898, Marie Curie (1867–1934), then a graduate student married the already well-known French physicist Pierre Curie (1859–1906), began her doctoral study of Becquerel’s rays. She and her husband soon discovered two new radioactive elements, which she named **polonium** (after her native land) and **radium** (because it radiates). These two new elements filled holes in the periodic table and, further, displayed much higher levels of radioactivity per gram of material than uranium. Over a period of four years, working under poor conditions and spending their own funds, the Curies processed more than a ton of uranium ore to isolate a gram of radium salt. Radium became highly sought after, because it was about two million times as radioactive as uranium. Curie’s radium salt glowed visibly from the radiation that took its toll on them and other unaware researchers. Shortly after completing her Ph.D., both Curies and Becquerel shared the 1903 Nobel Prize in physics for their work on radioactivity. Pierre was killed in a horse cart accident in 1906, but Marie continued her study of radioactivity for nearly 30 more years. Awarded the 1911 Nobel Prize in chemistry for her discovery of two new elements, she remains the only person to win Nobel Prizes in physics and chemistry. Marie’s radioactive fingerprints on some pages of her notebooks can still expose film, and she suffered from radiation-induced lesions. She died of leukemia likely caused by radiation, but she was active in research almost until her death in 1934. The following year, her daughter and son-in-law, Irene and Frederic Joliot-Curie, were awarded the Nobel Prize in chemistry for their discovery of artificially induced radiation, adding to a remarkable family legacy.

# Alpha, Beta, and Gamma

Research begun by people such as New Zealander Ernest Rutherford soon after the discovery of nuclear radiation indicated that different types of rays are emitted. Eventually, three types were distinguished and named **alpha**{: data-type="term" #import-auto-id1427002}<math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mrow><mfenced open="(" close=")"><mi>α</mi></mfenced></mrow><mrow /></mrow><annotation encoding="StarMath 5.0"> size 12{ left (α right )} {}</annotation></semantics></math>

 *radiation is the emission of a helium nucleus*. Rutherford won the Nobel Prize in chemistry in 1908 for his early work. He continued to make important contributions until his death in 1934.

 s remain unaffected by electric and magnetic fields, it is natural to think they might be photons.

# Ionization and Range

 rays were recognized very early. All three types of nuclear radiation produce **ionization** in materials, but they penetrate different distances in materials—that is, they have different **ranges**. Let us examine why they have these characteristics and what are some of the consequences.

Like x rays, nuclear radiation in the form of <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mrow><mi>α</mi></mrow><mrow /></mrow><annotation encoding="StarMath 5.0"> size 12{α} {}</annotation></semantics></math>

 s has enough energy per event to ionize atoms and molecules in any material. The energy emitted in various nuclear decays ranges from a few <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mrow><mtext>keV</mtext></mrow><mrow /></mrow><annotation encoding="StarMath 5.0"> size 12{"keV"} {}</annotation></semantics></math>

 to more than <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mrow><mtext>10 MeV</mtext></mrow><mrow /></mrow><annotation encoding="StarMath 5.0"> size 12{"10 MeV"} {}</annotation></semantics></math>

, while only a few <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mrow><mtext>eV</mtext></mrow><mrow /></mrow><annotation encoding="StarMath 5.0"> size 12{"eV"} {}</annotation></semantics></math>

 are needed to produce ionization. The effects of x rays and nuclear radiation on biological tissues and other materials, such as solid state electronics, are directly related to the ionization they produce. All of them, for example, can damage electronics or kill cancer cells. In addition, methods for detecting x rays and nuclear radiation are based on ionization, directly or indirectly. All of them can ionize the air between the plates of a capacitor, for example, causing it to discharge. This is the basis of inexpensive personal radiation monitors, such as pictured in [\[link\]](#import-auto-id1900612). Apart from <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mrow><mi>α</mi></mrow><mrow /></mrow><annotation encoding="StarMath 5.0"> size 12{α} {}</annotation></semantics></math>

, there are other forms of nuclear radiation as well, and these also produce ionization with similar effects. We define **ionizing radiation**{: data-type="term" #import-auto-id2968914}**** as any form of radiation that produces ionization whether nuclear in origin or not, since the effects and detection of the radiation are related to ionization.

![Image shows a person&#x2019;s hand holding a cylindrical object placed near a small piece of radioactive material. A dial indicator is connected to the cylindrical radiation detector.](../resources/Figure_32_01_03a.jpg "These dosimeters (literally, dose meters) are personal radiation monitors that detect the amount of radiation by the discharge of a rechargeable internal capacitor. The amount of discharge is related to the amount of ionizing radiation encountered, a measurement of dose. One dosimeter is shown in the charger. Its scale is read through an eyepiece on the top. (credit: L. Chang, Wikimedia Commons)"){: #import-auto-id1900612}

The **range of radiation**{: data-type="term" #import-auto-id1587169} is defined to be the distance it can travel through a material. Range is related to several factors, including the energy of the radiation, the material encountered, and the type of radiation (see [\[link\]](#import-auto-id3385282)). The higher the **energy**, the greater the range, all other factors being the same. This makes good sense, since radiation loses its energy in materials primarily by producing ionization in them, and each ionization of an atom or a molecule requires energy that is removed from the radiation. The amount of ionization is, thus, directly proportional to the energy of the particle of radiation, as is its range.

![Three cases of range of radiation are shown. The first case shows that higher energy has greater range than lower energy. The second case shows that, for same energy material having high electron density will have lower range. The third case shows that among alpha beta and gamma rays for the same energy alphas have the smallest range betas have a greater range and gammas penetrate the farthest.](../resources/Figure_32_01_04a.jpg "The penetration or range of radiation depends on its energy, the material it encounters, and the type of radiation. (a) Greater energy means greater range. (b) Radiation has a smaller range in materials with high electron density. (c) Alphas have the smallest range, betas have a greater range, and gammas penetrate the farthest."){: #import-auto-id3385282}



Radiation can be absorbed or shielded by materials, such as the lead aprons dentists drape on us when taking x rays. Lead is a particularly effective shield compared with other materials, such as plastic or air. How does the range of radiation depend on **material**? Ionizing radiation interacts best with charged particles in a material. Since electrons have small masses, they most readily absorb the energy of the radiation in collisions. The greater the density of a material and, in particular, the greater the density of electrons within a material, the smaller the range of radiation.

<div data-type="note" data-label="" markdown="1">

Collisions
</div>
Conservation of energy and momentum often results in energy transfer to a less massive object in a collision. This was discussed in detail in [Work, Energy, and Energy Resources](/m42145), for example.

</div>

Different **types** of radiation have different ranges when compared at the same energy and in the same material. Alphas have the shortest range, betas penetrate farther, and gammas have the greatest range. This is directly related to charge and speed of the particle or type of radiation. At a given energy, each <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>α</mi></mrow></semantics></math>

The more readily the particle produces ionization, the more quickly it will lose its energy. The effect of **charge** is as follows: The <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mrow><mi>α</mi></mrow><mrow /></mrow><annotation encoding="StarMath 5.0"> size 12{α} {}</annotation></semantics></math>

# Section Summary

* {: #import-auto-id1272247} Some nuclei are radioactive—they spontaneously decay destroying some part of their mass and emitting energetic rays, a process called nuclear radioactivity.
* {: #import-auto-id3094443} Nuclear radiation, like x rays, is ionizing radiation, because energy sufficient to ionize matter is emitted in each decay.
* {: #import-auto-id2381952} The range (or distance traveled in a material) of ionizing radiation is directly related to the charge of the emitted particle and its energy, with greater-charge and lower-energy particles having the shortest ranges.
* {: #import-auto-id1916326} Radiation detectors are based directly or indirectly upon the ionization created by radiation, as are the effects of radiation on living and inert materials.
